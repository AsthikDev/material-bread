## Goals

<section>

#### More Components

Currently one must mix and match libraries to utilize all the material components found in the guidelines. This can create inconsistencies in the design and api of your app's components. Additionally, there's no guarantee that those components will work well together. Therefore, the main goal of this package is to provide all components found in the Material Docs.

#### Highly Customizable

Having almost complete control over the styling of every component is a crucial feature of UI libraries for the following reasons:

1. There will always be something that needs to be slightly changed or different. Packages that make it difficult to customize quickly become more of a burden then a useful tool.

2. Having more control over the component allows the developer to possibly fix edge cases or issues themselves rather than wait for a new release of the package.

3. More customization allows developers to build their own components on top package components.

React Native provides a unique challenge for customization since you cannot select any element you want with CSS and override all the styles. This means that itâ€™s important to design and build customization into each component from the ground up.

#### Copious Live Demos

Demos make it much easier to understand how to use components and how to build common patterns. Since this library is deicated to providing Material Design components, it is important to provide as many demos as needed to illustrate reproducing various patterns.
